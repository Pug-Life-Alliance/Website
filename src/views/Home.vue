          PLA was created with a single goal in mind, to bring the joy back into
          playing games. Somewhere along the way we, as gamers, lost the simple
          joy and relief that living in a fantasy world brings. We donâ€™t want to
          have to work or feel like we are obligated to play, we want to dive
          into a story and get lost for a few hours and escape the world. If you
          are looking for a group of like minded people to play with, come and
          join us. Together we will save games...
